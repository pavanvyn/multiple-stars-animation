# Create pretty animations of binaries, triples and quadruples

This is a python3-based simple N-body integrator and animator for 2-body, 3-body and 4-body systems. The initial conditions can be supplied in hierarchical coordinates: masses and orbital parameters, including semimajor axes, eccentricities, and orbital angles.
