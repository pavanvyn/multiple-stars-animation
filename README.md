This is a python3-based simple N-body integrator and animator of binary-, triple- and quadruple-star systems. Th code will be edited for a better UI, but for now, running the python module produces an animation of a stable triple-star system. To run a binary and/or 3+1/2+2 quadruple systems, uncomment the respective blocks in the python module. Change the position and velocity parameters for different orbits, possibly unstable.
